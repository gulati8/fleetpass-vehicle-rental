# Refactor Workflow

You are orchestrating a code refactoring for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Initialize
1. Create state file: `.claude/state/{date}_refactor_{slug}.md`
2. Log the refactoring goals
3. Set status to IN_PROGRESS

### Phase 2: Analyze
Use the `researcher` subagent to:
- Understand current implementation
- Map dependencies and usages
- Identify code smells or issues
- Find patterns to follow

### Phase 3: Plan
Use the `planner` subagent to:
- Design the refactoring approach
- Break into safe, incremental steps
- Plan rollback strategy
- Identify risks

**Checkpoint**: Present refactoring plan for approval.

### Phase 4: Prepare Tests
Use the `test-writer` subagent to:
- Ensure existing test coverage is adequate
- Add tests if needed to catch regressions
- Run tests to establish baseline

### Phase 5: Refactor
Use the `code-writer` subagent for each refactoring step:
- Make changes incrementally
- Run tests after each step
- Update state file with progress

### Phase 6: Review
Use the `code-reviewer` subagent to:
- Verify refactoring goals were met
- Check for regressions
- Confirm code quality improved

### Phase 7: Complete
1. Update state file status to COMPLETED
2. Summarize changes and improvements
